# Academic DevOps Project

This project is an example of a DevOps pipeline integrating various technologies such as Jenkins for CI/CD, Docker for containerization, Git for version control, JUnit for testing, SonarQube for code quality analysis, Nexus for artifact repository management, Docker Compose for multi-container Docker applications, and Grafana for monitoring.

## Project Structure

- `optimizers-core-main`: Contains the core application code.
- `optimizers-client-master`: Contains the client application code.

Each directory contains its own Dockerfile and source code for the respective part of the application.

## Technology Stack

- **Jenkins**: Automation server used to build and deploy the application.
- **Docker**: Container platform used to package the application with all its dependencies.
- **Git**: Version control system to track changes in the codebase.
- **JUnit**: Framework used for writing and running repeatable automated tests.
- **SonarQube**: Tool for continuous inspection of code quality.
- **Nexus**: Repository manager that supports the storage of artifacts.
- **Docker Compose**: Tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
- **Grafana**: Analytics and interactive visualization platform.

## Setup and Installation
